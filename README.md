# virtual_assistant

In this project i have used following python modules:

```
Pyttsx3
datetime
speechRecognition
wikipedia
webbrowser
os
random
```

This is a virtual assistant named friend.

When the code executes, the assistant will greet the user according to the current time and give its brief introduction.

To initialize it, call it by its name like: ```"Hey friend!"``` or ```"Ok Friend!"```
After it initializes, it will take a command from the user.

The user can give commands like:

```"Open google" or "Open youtube".```
```User can search for anything on the wikipedia by saying something like: "Search for``` *anything* ```on wikipedia". ```
```This assistant can also tell the current time. User can do this by saying something like: "What is the time now?"```
```There is a folder named music along with this code. When the user says something like: "Play music", it will automatically play a random song from the list of songs.```

The user can add more songs to the music folder.
